## Notes

The web page of the "Musée d'histoire naturelle Fribourg" can be viewed using HTTPS. However, the page opens an "i-frame" in HTTP and this leads to "mix content" problems. So if you use the [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) extension, you will have to temporarily disable the "mix content protection".
